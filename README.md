# birthdayTgRs
First project in Rust with the purpose to create a Telegram bot which interacts with a database.

The purpose of the bot is to accumulate birthday dates with the command:
```
/add Name day-of-the-month month-of-the-year reminder-delay
```

And to remind you each day at you specified config:
```
/updateconfig hour minute
```
of your incoming birthday.


Find the bot on Telegram [http://t.me/HB_westornd_bot](@HB_westornd_bot)
